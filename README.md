Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v25
- Android Build Tools v25.0.3

Getting Started
---------------

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Inspiration
----------------
I am very interested in Chinese idioms and want to help other people learn them. Resources 
available online for English speaking people is limited. So I want to use both YouTube and 
an app to help people learn Chengyu.
This project is also part of Udacity's [Android Developer NanoDegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801?v=ad1).
